# Repository public_examples
A public repository used to show others examples of my code.

Primary languages are Python 3.7 and PostgreSQL. 

Files will be named by their directory containing `__init__.py` and supporting files/directories when needed.

Source is https://github.com/willhasgithub/public_examples
## Python examples
- `/csv_manipulation/__init__.py`
    - Primarily uses Pandas to perform a couple of simple methods/manipulations on a tab-delimited text file.
- `/simple_api/__init__.py`
    - Uses Flask to create a very simple API endpoint to perform a set action and log the inputs and outputs in a JSON file.
- `/edabit_coding_challenges/__init__.py`
    - These challeges are found on Edabit.com. I sometimes do these for fun and might be useful to see how I work though problems using python.
